## Abstract 

*We live in an age of openness and honesty.*

Yet the gambling industry is stuck in the past. Stealing money from consumers or, at best, not able to prove their honesty.


Consumers (synonmyns : Gamblers, Players, Punters, Users, Betters) have lost trust with the institutions they place bets with. Any game that can be fixed, is at risk of being fixed. This becomes even more apparent when games are a blackbox where no one can see the inner workings. 

How can a consumer know if they lost fairly or are being cheated?

## Introduction

In this paper, we are proposing a world where the gambling industry is more open and honest, not through trust, but through technical contract at protocol level.  In essence, transactions between parties where the consumer doesn't need to trust the casino (or other gambling platform). For this we need a blockchain, a wallet that is KYC linked to a consumer, a white-label out-of-the-box crypto-enabled casino, a self-service on-boarding platform for Casinos, and a future-proof high-frequency blockchain protocol specific for the gambling industry which can handle the transaction speed of any casino or sportsbook.  




## Phase 1
- Proof of Authority (PoA) network
- Smart Contracts
- Mobile first web wallet
- Identity claims, Login with VoX

## Phase 2
- Regional side chains
- Privacy

## Phase 3
- State channels

## ERC20 Security Token on our permissioned PoA network

We will launch on a permissioned network with the current casino customers as the authority nodes. VOX tokens will be issued in the form of ERC20 tokens. Users can store their VOX tokens in the VOX wallet.

## VoX Wallet
Users must identify themselves through KYC and then create (or import their seed) their account within the wallet.

We enable existing fiat casinos to enter our ecosystem by allowing consumers to "Login with VoX".  
This is used in place of their normal login/signup or by association with their existing login (since there will be many existing users). 

Consumers can transfer VWT tokens into their casino account once they are authorised, this initiates a market exchange of the tokens to fiat currency  (insert diagram).

Consumers can then play at the casino with their normal casino games in fiat currency.
Upon withdrawal, a market exchange occurs back to the tokens straight into the VoX wallet.  Note: it is up to the casino to enforce AML requirements of the withdraw amounts >= deposit amounts in that deposit method.


## Fiat / BTC / VOX Casinos
Demonstrating "Login with VoX" and allowing consumers to play classic casino games in fiat currency but with deposit and withdraw as VWT tokens. But in this model, the casino hold the funds and need to be trusted in the traditional way.

## Varius Online Exchange
The main problem with new currencies is that there is no liquidity

## VIProtocol
This is our proprietary blockchain protocol with the main currency as VoX.

VIP is different to other blockchains because it is specific to the needs of the gambling industry.  It is not designed to be used by other industries.

For example:
- Login blocking for problem gamblers / AML violators
- Anonymously blocking your own ability to gamble at controlled times
- Privacy between Casinos but bigger picture reporting on the data across all casinos
- Random number generation
- Visible decentralised RTP per game
- AI to spot problematic gamblers and money launderers
